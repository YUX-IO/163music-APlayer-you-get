# 1AYGD

*a [**2020 Arctic Vault program**](https://archiveprogram.github.com) project*



Many thanks for all of your support, this was a sideproject for my noob blog when I was a maths student at UPMC (Sorbonne Universit√© Campus Pierre et Marie Curie),  I cannot even bear to look at it now. If you find it in 3020 at the North Pole, which I hope not, please take the limitations of the times into account.

## 163music-APlayer-you-get BETA5 init


> I just rewrote everything.

- This project now moved to Python-3.5.1. You may pull a docker image from [yuxio/flask-python351](https://hub.docker.com/r/yuxio/flask-python351/) to play with.
- Now the back-end search requests is asynchronous. Thanks to [requests-futures](https://github.com/ross/requests-futures). It's like at least 5 times faster than normal python-requests
- And there is the second version of API for getting music info.
- I tried to use [DPlayer](https://github.com/DIYgod/DPlayer) - a lovely HTML5 danmaku video playerüç≠, there is a [demo](http://diygod.github.io/DPlayer/demo), but it seems the MV from 163Music has a Referer test or something to block it. It's too bad.‚åá‚óèÔπè‚óè‚åá It might be fixed by a fake-referer from a JavaScript of Dplayer or I don't know. It's very cool when I tested it locally. I tried to add a proxy from my server back-end, it works but it takes too much bandwidth. DaoCloud would kill me for that.
- The music player is always [APlayer](http://aplayer.js.org/) by [DIYgod](https://www.anotherhome.net/).
- Add Radio.
- All the APIs of 163Music are from [you-get](https://you-get.org/). Use it if you want to download songs of videos.
- Tout est mieux Ÿ©(Àä·óúÀã*)Ÿà

### The web interface
[https://music.daoapp.io/](https://music.daoapp.io/)
The front-end is folked from [No JS: Tabs that scale down to menu](http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/pen/KBsIo) and [Search Box](http://codepen.io/siwicki/pen/FHkwu). I want somebody to teach me how to do those magic sometime
